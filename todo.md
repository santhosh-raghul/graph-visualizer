# general
- [x] write functions to create node, edge
- [x] call these functions, replacing the old line by line code
- [ ] write functions to draw graph from
	- [ ] adjacency list
	- [ ] adjacency matrix
	- [ ] edge list
- [x] find a way to let the user navigate through the algorithm steps
- [x] design ui to use the functions
- [x] find a way to disable drawing while simulationg an algorithm
# algorithms to implement
