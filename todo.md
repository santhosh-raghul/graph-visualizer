# general
- [ ] write functions to create node, edge
- [ ] call these functions, replacing the old line by line code
- [ ] write functions to draw graph from
	- [ ] adjacency list
	- [ ] adjacency matrix
	- [ ] edge list
- [ ] find a way to let the user navigate through the algorithm steps
- [ ] design ui to use the functions
