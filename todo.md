# general
- [ ] write functions to create node, edge
- [ ] call these functions, replacing the old line by line code
- [ ] write functions to draw graph from
	- [ ] adjacency list
	- [ ] adjacency matrix
	- [ ] edge list
- [x] find a way to let the user navigate through the algorithm steps
- [ ] design ui to use the functions
- [ ] find a way to disable drawing while simulationg an algorithm
# algorithms to implement
## Undirected

- [x] DFS
	- [ ] connected components
- [ ] BFS

## Directed

- [ ] Shortest Path 
	- [ ] Dijkstra's
	- [ ] Bellman-Ford

# other ideas <sub><sup><sub><sup> (to implement after completing the basic requirements if possible) </sup></sub></sup></sub>
 - [ ] rearranging nodes (for the sake/at the end of an algorithm or just rearrange)
 - [ ] save the graph in bw page reload / while visiting other pages
